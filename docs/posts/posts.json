    "contents": "\r\nThis week’s Tidy Tuesday challenge included data from the Tate, a large art museum in the United Kingdom. Datasets related to the Tate included (1) information about artists represented and (2) information about each artwork. Looking at others’ amazing plots on twitter I noticed both mentions of the low number of female artists and graphs outlining the top artists, who were all male. I decided to make a treemap of the most-represented female artists to get their names out there.\r\n\r\n\r\nlibrary (tidyverse)\r\nlibrary (treemapify)\r\nlibrary (showtext)\r\n\r\n## Loading Google fonts (https://fonts.google.com/)\r\nfont_add_google(\"Montserrat\")\r\n\r\n## Automatically use showtext to render text\r\nshowtext_auto()\r\n\r\n#read in data\r\nartwork <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2021/2021-01-12/artwork.csv')\r\nartists <- readr::read_csv(\"https://github.com/tategallery/collection/raw/master/artist_data.csv\")\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLearnings this week:\r\nI got the showtext package to work after an online resource pointed out that I needed to download the font to my computer AND load it in R.
